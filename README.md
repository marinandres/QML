# Quantum Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN) Circuit Overview

This repository implements a **Variational Quantum Circuit** used in a **Quantum Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN)**. The quantum circuit processes input data through encoding, variational transformations, entanglement, and measurement to produce quantum-based output representations.

## Quantum Circuit Architecture

### 1. Input Encoding

- Each qubit \( q_0 \) to \( q_4 \) is initialized in the ground state \( |0\rangle \).
- Input values \([0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]\) are encoded using **RX gates**.
- The RX gate applies a rotation around the X-axis of the Bloch sphere:

  \[
  RX(\theta) = e^{-i \frac{\theta}{2} X}
  \]

  where \( X \) is the Pauli-X matrix, and \( \theta \) is proportional to the input value (e.g., \( \theta = 0.5 \) for \( q_0 \)).

---

### 2. Variational Layers

- Each qubit receives a series of **trainable RX and RZ gates**:
  
  \[
  RZ(\phi) = e^{-i \frac{\phi}{2} Z}
  \]

  where \( Z \) is the Pauli-Z matrix, and \( \phi \) is a trainable parameter.
- For example, qubit \( q_0 \) might be transformed as:

  \[
  RX(0.1) \rightarrow RZ(0.2) \rightarrow RX(0.3)
  \]

- These parameters are optimized during training to learn temporal patterns.

---

### 3. Entanglement

- **CNOT gates** (controlled-NOT) are applied to entangle adjacent qubits, creating a **linear chain** of entanglement.
- Entanglement enables the model to capture complex correlations between input features.

---

### 4. Measurement

- After the variational and entangling operations, all qubits are **measured** in the computational basis \( \{ |0\rangle, |1\rangle \} \).
- Each measurement produces a classical bitstring (e.g., `10010`), representing the collapsed quantum state.

---

## Understanding Measurement Results

### 1. Quantum State Evolution

The state of the quantum system evolves as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{2^n - 1} \alpha_i |i\rangle
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of qubits,
- \( |i\rangle \) is a basis state (bitstring),
- \( \alpha_i \) is the complex amplitude of that state,
- \( |\alpha_i|^2 \) is the probability of measuring \( |i\rangle \).

---

### 2. Measurement Probabilities

After running the circuit multiple times (shots), we collect bitstring counts. The **probability** of a bitstring \( |i\rangle \) is:

\[
P(|i\rangle) = \frac{\text{count}(|i\rangle)}{\text{total counts}}
\]

For example, if `00000` is observed 220 times out of 1024 shots:

\[
P(|00000\rangle) = \frac{220}{1024} \approx 0.215
\]

### 3. Example Measurement Output

```
{
  "00000": 220,
  "10001": 180,
  "11110": 150,
  ...
}
```

- The **most frequent bitstrings** correspond to the **most probable quantum states** influenced by input encoding and learned parameters.

## Quantum Concepts Recap

| Concept        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Superposition** | Each qubit is in a mixture of \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \) after RX encoding. |
| **Entanglement** | CNOT gates entangle qubits, allowing complex correlations. |
| **Measurement**  | The quantum state collapses to a classical outcome based on measurement probabilities. |

## Key Takeaways

- This quantum circuit functions as a **recurrent unit**, with variational layers learning temporal dependencies.
- The **input values guide the initial quantum state**, and **trainable gates** shape the quantum evolution.
- The final bitstring distributions reflect the **learned patterns** in the sequence data, forming the foundation for quantum sequence learning.
